## Hello there, I'm Ed! 👋

I'm a platform engineer working primarily on AWS but with Azure and (some) GCP experience. 

### 😁 I'm in my happy place when I'm
 - Scripting/Automating stuff
 - Working with containers (and container orchestration!)
 - Improving developer experience by helping them to deliver software quicker, and more safely
 - Building and engineering cloud infrastructure
 - Learning!
